in someone's face
in someone's heart of hearts
in someone's mind's eye
in someone's shoes

that's about the size of it
(that's) a likely story
that's all i need
that's life
the cat's whiskers
there's more to someone than meets the eye
there's no accounting for taste
there's no smoke without fire
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no time like the present
the time of someone's life
third time's a charm
times flies when you're having fun
to someone's heart's content
try someone's hand
turn someone's hand to
two wrongs don't make a right
up to someone's ears in something
water off a duck's back
what's more
what's the magic word
what's the world coming to
where there's a will there's a way
wouldn't be caught dead
wouldn't be seen dead
wouldn't hurt a fly
wouldn't touch something with a barge pole
wrap someone's head around something
you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs
you scratch my back and i'll scratch yours
you've got me there
